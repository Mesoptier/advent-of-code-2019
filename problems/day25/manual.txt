Trial and mostly error:
no items -> too light
boulder -> too light
boulder + mutex -> too light
mouse -> too light
mutex -> too light

Determining relative weight:
spool of cat6 < sand
spool of cat6 < mouse
spool of cat6 < astronaut ice cream
spool of cat6 < mutex
spool of cat6 < antenna
boulder < sand
boulder < mouse
antenna < mouse

All items:
- mutex
- spool of cat6
- hypercube
- astronaut ice cream
- boulder
- antenna
- sand
- mouse

Result:
- mouse
- astronaut ice cream
- boulder
- sand
